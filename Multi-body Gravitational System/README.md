This project is about creating a multi-body simulation. I used solar system as an example.

The main idea was to use Object-Oriented Programming in Python to be able to create simulations that may require multiple different interacting bodies. We also used Euler's method to do a numerical approximation of Kinematic Equations of motion. It was the most sensible and easy approximation technique. But, it does have it's drawbacks. We know that Euler's method overshoots or undershoots and hence, the energy will not be conserved. There will be new energy added to the system over time. Similarly with radii, because the forward Euler method undershoots the answer, the radii will keep expanding.


## Current Status

I am not actively working on this project anymore. There is howere some errors which prevent the display of the 3-body system. The 2-body systems runs perfectly.


## Setting up and running the code


The code notebook was run on a local machine with python 3.9.7 and worked for most of the part. The animation may experience difficulties with online jupyter notebook applications such as Google Colab.
