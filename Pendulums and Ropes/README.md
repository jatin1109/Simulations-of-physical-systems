# Rigid Body Systems in Python

Before this project, I had only worked with point systems or considered them to be a single point most of the times. The goal was to not make that assumption and simulate compound systems that span a wider space and are (mostly) continuous.
To do this, I had 2 simulations to build, the first one being pendulums and then generalizing it to a rope. 


## Simple Pendulums

The idea was simple, I was using numerical estimation methods to simulate simple pendulums. This was possible because analytical solutions for simple pendulums are possible.


This project is mostly complete.

## Ropes

We had to take a different approach for this since using multiple pendulums would have been very computationally expensive. 
But, we still kept the idea to discretize the rope into smaller parts.


Credits: Most of the code in rope simulation is not written by me. It was written by my friend and classmate Frederik Hardervig who was working on the problem with me.


### Status

The rope simulation doesn't work at this moment, so the project is incomplete, but I have lost much of my interest in this project and am instead working on a separate problem.
