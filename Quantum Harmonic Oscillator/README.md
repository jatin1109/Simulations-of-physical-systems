# Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

This project aims to build a simulation for Quantum Harmonic Oscillator. The simulation predicts the probability and time evolution of coherent states that undergo oscillation.

There are two notebooks, the first one visualizes the stationary states in a Quantum system. The second notebook has the simulation.
