# Computational Fluid Dynamics


In this project, I aim to build a simulation of Fluid Dynamics. The approach taken is to use numerical methods to discretize the Navier Stokes equation and use it
to plan the update step. 


References and more instructions on how the code works are given in the beginning of the code workbook.


## Status
I am no longer working on this particular project. That does not mean the code here is perfect. I have found many redundancies in the work, but I do not plan to fix them. 
Instead, I will be using this project as a base for other bigger projects.
